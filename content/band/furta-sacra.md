= FURTA SACRA

**Furta Sacra** is a group of misfits from Atascadero State Hospital. They're new up and comers
in the horror music scene. They have more horror experience than anyone I've met,
being confined to four walls has really brought out the brutalness of their tracks.*

== Members
* **Flash Bannister** - Vocals and Guitar, Fashion Icon
* **Frater Sus** - Percussion and the *TORTURED SOULS*
* **Stonewall Jackson** - Keyboards and SFX (Foley work)

== Songs
* [DDEA]({{<ref "/music/ddea.md">}})

\*Due to the brutality of performances live shows ***ARE NOT*** recommended.
